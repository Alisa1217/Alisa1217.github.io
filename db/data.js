The banner app is a web application that allows any user to create banners without any knowledge of code. It can load different banner formats with different languages for specific clients. Then, with a WYSIWYG editor created from scratch, the user can modify the content and style of the project. When everything is perfect the banner can be exported for both HTML or image file to the local machine with a click of a button. With this tool the banner creation time could be reduced to one third of the manual build. The banner app is available only in the intranet of Webloyalty.",
